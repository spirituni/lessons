  if blocks (logic gates):

    1. since aki is battery powered, we need to know when to charge aki - using if/else if/else statements try plugging aki in when she has no power

    2. let's make sure aki's indicator shows when she's charging - using if/else statements:

      i. make isCharging true when aki is pluggedIn

      ii. for her battery health, we also need to make sure that aki doesn't keep charging when her battery is already 100%

    remember, logic gates you can use are:
    - !  (NOT)
    - || (OR)
    - && (AND)

/*
  if blocks (comparators):
  
    3. just to be safe, aki should be charged before her battery is completely empty - using an if statement, 

    4. aki doesn't want her indicator to be scary red all the time - using if/else if/else statements, change the color to:
    - red (0)
    - yellow (1-50)
    - green (51-100)

    remember, comparators you can use are:
    - == (equal to)
    - >  (greater than)
    - >= (greater than or equal to)
    - <  (less than)
    - <= (less than or equal to)
