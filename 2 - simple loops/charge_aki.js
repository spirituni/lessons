      ii. using two while loops, have the bar show filled boxes for every 10% of battery that aki has

      iii. now do it using one while loop and an if block (if/else/else if statements)!

  for loops:

    2. let's try to make all of those again, but with for loops instead of while loops!

      i. using a for loop, make a bar full of 10 empty boxes

      ii. using two for loops, have the bar show filled boxes for every 10% of battery that aki has

  (bonus) constants:
    3. instead of writing out the length of the bar each time, try using a constant!
    
    4. now do all the loops using decrements (--) instead of increments (++), but make sure to keep the battery bar behaviour the same
